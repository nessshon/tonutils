**Tonutils** is a high-level, object-oriented Python library designed to simplify interactions with the TON blockchain.
It seamlessly integrates several prominent services for working with TON:

* **RPC API**
    * [tonapi.io](https://tonapi.io) – REST API to the TON blockchain explorer.
    * [toncenter.com](https://toncenter.com) – fast and reliable HTTP API for The Open Network.
    * [quicknode.com](https://www.quicknode.com/) – low-latency HTTP API access to TON via global infrastructure.
    * [tatum.io](https://tatum.io) – RPCs and APIs powering Web3. Fast, reliable, affordable.

* **Native ADNL**
    * [pytoniq](https://github.com/yungwine/pytoniq) – library for direct interaction with Lite servers.

By combining these services, Tonutils provides a powerful and flexible toolset for developers, making it easier to build
on top of the TON ecosystem.

## Installation

```bash
pip install "tonutils<2.0"
```

To use `pytoniq` with Native ADNL connection, install it with the optional dependencies, including
the [pytoniq](https://github.com/yungwine/pytoniq) library:
